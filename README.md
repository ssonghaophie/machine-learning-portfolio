# Welcome !

I’m Sophie Song, a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Statistical & Data Sciences at Smith College. I recently took a course about machine learning and gained more interest in this field. To briefly illustrate what I explored in machine learning, I learned various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms that are used to train the data provided and predict the outcome to make meaningful use of the data. 

The skills I have in machine learning:
- Models I can apply to the data: 
  - Supervised Learning
    - Prediction
      - Linear Regression
      - Polynomial Regression
    - Classification
      - Logistic Regression
      - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
      - K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)
      - **Decision Tree**
      - Random Forest 
  - Unsupervised Learning
    - Dimension Reduction
      - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      - **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
    - Clustering
      - K-Means
  - Deep Learning
    - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Others:
  - Gradient Descent for optimization
  - **Cross-Validation for train-test data**

Among these skills, I’m more confident in utilizing KNN, Decision Tree, PCA, SVD, K-Means, Gradient Descent, and Cross-Validation algorithms because I have experience in implementing these from scratch using Python. 

In this portfolio, I’m aiming to expand my machine-learning knowledge by specifically focusing on Classification, Deep Learning, and Recommendation algorithms. I hope that by going through my portfolio, one can get a sense of how different models can be used in different problem-solving tasks, and how machine learning can be applied anywhere and everywhere including the field of one’s interest.  

For Classification, I’m comparing SVD and Decision Tree Classifiers by performing Cross-Validation to fit the models and assessing their accuracy and error rate. Inside the Classification directory, there are the files listed:
  - **README.md** file with the goal, approach, and findings of this project summarized
  - **Classification.ipynb** file that guides the codes of my project with some documentation in Jupyter notebook
  - **Classification.py** and **test_classification.py** files for performing unit tests on the functions used in my project
  - **Personality.csv** file which is the data used
  - The screenshot of my local test passing

For Deep Learning, I’m performing image classification by training CNN on the validation data and predicting the classification on the image of the test data. Inside the Deep Learning directory, there are the files listed:
  - **README.md** file with the goal, approach, and findings of this project summarized
  - **Image classification.ipynb** file that guides the codes of my project with some documentation in Google colab
 
 
For Recommendation, I’m performing content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to recommend items by similar items and users. Cosine similarity is used as a metric to assess item similarities, and SVD is used for collaborative filtering. Inside the Recommender System directory, there are the files listed:
  - **README.md** file with the goal, approach, and findings of this project summarized
  - **Filtering.ipynb** file that guides the codes of my project with some documentation in Jupyter notebook
  - **Filtering.py** and **test_filtering.py** files for performing unit tests on the functions used in my project
  - **Anime.csv**  and **rating.csv** file which are the data used
  - The screenshot of my local test passing

Outside of machine learning, I’m also interested in watching anime, drama, and game videos. I like to analyze the character and their personalities from those media, and see how the character traits differ from one another. I also enjoy singing and playing guitar in my spare time. Therefore, I’m hoping to apply the machine learning techniques I learned to my hobbies and interests in this project to make it even more fun and accessible to people who think that machine learning is for only industry and academia.
